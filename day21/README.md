# Day 21: Professional Developer Portfolio üöÄ

üë®‚Äçüíª This is the final project of my intensive learning journey! Today, I built a complete, professional portfolio website to showcase my skills, my story, and the projects I've built. This site acts as my digital resume, a central hub for my work, and a point of contact for potential employers and collaborators.

## ‚ú® Key Features

1.  **Personal Branding:** A clean and modern design with a consistent theme that reflects my professional identity as a MERN stack developer. I've included an 'About Me' section detailing my skills and passion for technology.
2.  **Dynamic Project Showcase:** A dedicated, visually appealing section displaying my major projects from this series, including the E-commerce Store, Trello Clone, and Social Media Dashboard. Each project includes a description, the tech stack used, and links to the code.
3.  **Functional Contact Form:** A fully operational contact form that allows visitors to send me a message directly. It's powered by a dedicated **Node.js/Express** backend that uses **Nodemailer** to forward the message to my email address.
4.  **Responsive Design:** The entire website is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
